Approximation of the cumulative distribution function (cdf) for arbitrary 18 decimal fixed point parameters `x`, `Î¼`, `Ïƒ` and a target absolute error of 1e-8.

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

The complementary error function (`erfc`) is approximated rationally using a variant from the algorithm presented in [this](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/552.pdf) paper. The rational polynomial is composed of a polynomial of degree 11 as numerator, and a polynomial of degree 4 as denominator.

The coefficients of the rational polynomial are scaled by a factor of 2^96 and then codified as part of the `erfc` function. This scaling allows for the use of cheaper `sar` (shift arithmetic right) operations instead of more expensive `sdiv` (signed division) operations (former costs 3 gas, while latter 5). Additionally, this function always returns 0 when the input is more than `4.0523` as the maximum absolute error would not surpass the target error.

The `erfc` and `cdf` functions are differentially fuzzed against Python and Javascript implementations to ensure that they provide an absolute error of less than 1e-8. These functions are also benchmarked against [`solstat`](https://github.com/primitivefinance/solstat), [`gud-cdf`](https://github.com/Philogy/gud-cdf), and [`solidity-cdf`](https://github.com/fiveoutofnine/solidity-cdf). It's important to note that the benchmark does not verify the precision of these external libraries, such as `solidity-cdf`, which has an error of more than 1e-8.
